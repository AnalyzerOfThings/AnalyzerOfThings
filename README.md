- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnalyzerOfThings
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science. I believe that life is chaotic. We are presented with several choices for even the simplest of things.
-  As such, the way to make the best decisions is to analyze data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech(Information Technology) degree from Manipal University Jaipur, while learning Data Science online in my free time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all types of projects, as long as it involves the analysis of data.
- 📫 How to reach me: email- karn.var@gmail.com
